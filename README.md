# TerraMechTribes

## Overview

This is a board game with role-playing elements inspired by Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM), Frostpunk, and potentially Maze Runner. The game will be divided into three main phases:

1. **Base Building**: Players start by building a base, making difficult moral choices that will shape their environment.
2. **Hunting Phase**: Players form hunting parties to go out into the Zone to hunt for dangerous robotic creatures.
3. **Combat Phase**: Engage in tactical battles against AI-driven robotic foes.
